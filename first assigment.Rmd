# First assigment 

## What do I want to know and learn

* How to do scientific papers in R
* How to use Data , where to find it, specially. 

* I would also like to talk about the book [Bit by bit](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/) and get some explanation on how to use it properly for this course. 

* I would also expand some knowledge on the combination of Big Data and Psychology studies. 

* I also hope I will know by heart the Cheatsheet
